**Title: DJ’s Multi-year Stock Analysis**
 
**Overview: **
This is my assignment on learning how to develop VBA macros to analyze a file that consists of a large datasets of multi-year stocks with price values. Using this information, the following driven outputs were created:
•	Changing Ticker Symbol
•	Yearly change from opening to closing price of stock for three years
•	Percent change from opening to closing year stock value
•	Total Stock volume
•	Finding Greatest increase, decrease in percent value
•	Greatest increase in total stock volume


**Learnings:**
I learned how to use the VBA’s modules in looping through each year’s stock data. Also learned about functions that helped create conditional formatting, along with performing simple mathematical equations. Lastly, I learned about the applying the code throughout multiple sheets in a excel file using For Each loop.

**How to Use:**
Using the vs file named, “Sub Analysis 2”. Copy and paste the code to Excel file with the started stock data. Convert it into a macro-enabled file and then run it.
